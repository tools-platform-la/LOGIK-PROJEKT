**LOGIK-PROJEKT 2026**

Last year, I released my first software suite, LOGIK-PROJEKT — a modular, integrated pipeline toolkit centered around Autodesk Flame, that permits accelerated local development and instantaneous global collaboration. 

It marked my first public step toward open-source tooling that bridges logic, automation, and scalable, collaborative workflows.

This year, I’ve made significant improvements and added new features.

After a full codebase rewrite, I’m proud to introduce LOGIK-PROJEKT 2026 — rebuilt for the future of intelligent, collaborative development.

🔧 What’s New:
• LLM-friendly architecture for seamless integration with AI agents and conversational interfaces 
• Scripts to immediately create bespoke workflows and domain-specific extensions 
• Cleaner abstractions and improved documentation for faster onboarding and collaboration 

Whether you're building AI-augmented pipelines, automating system tasks, or exploring collaborative workflows, LOGIK-PROJEKT 2026 provides a robust, extensible foundation.

I’d love to hear what you'd like to see next.

Fork it, remix it, break it, improve it. 

Let’s build smarter together.
